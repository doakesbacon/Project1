Project Title: How Percent GDP Expenditure on Healthcare Affects Health Outcomes

Team Members: David Oakes, Bryson Webb, Alex Orvis, Christopher McCormick, Pascaline Njouwou

Project Description: Our team will compare various country's percent GDP expenditure on healthcare and the resulting health outcomes for that year to determine if there is a strong correlation between the two. We will also explore other factors that influence a country's health outcomes. We will consider the follow health outcomes: life expectancy, infant mortality, maternal mortality, leading cause of death, happiness score (?), chronic disease mortality, infectious disease mortality.

Research questions to answer: 
  -How does health care payment scheme affect percentage spent and health care outcomes
  -How does percent GDP affect health outcomes
  -Developed countries vs. undeveloped
  -Why is the US spending so much higher with reduced health outcomes

Datasets to be used: WHO Global Health Expenditure Database

-Organize the findings into a cohesive data story, refine research questions
-Assign sections to each group member
-Perform analysis
-Periodically meet to consolidate and review data
-Create an analysis write up
-Create presentation (10 minutes)
-Present
